  # Contiguous really means C-style contiguious.  The
  # contiguous part means that there are no 'skipped
  # elements'.  That is, that a flat_iter over the array will
  # touch every location in memory from the location of the
  # first element to that of the last element.  The C-style
  # part means that the data is laid out such that the last index
  # is the fastest varying as one scans though the array's
  # memory.
