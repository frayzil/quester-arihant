The x-y plane is the boundary between two transparent media.
Medium-1 with z > 0 has a refractive index of sqrt2 and
medium-2 with z < 0 has a refractive index  sqrt3.

A ray of lignt in medium-1 given by vector A = sqrt3 i - k
is incident on the plane of separation.

The unit vector in the direction of
the refracted ray in medium-2 is:

(a) 1/sqrt2 (k - i)
(b) 1/sqrt2 (i + j)
(c) 1/sqrt2 (i - k)
(d) 1/sqrt2 (i + k)
